# spamhamclassifer
In this project, I will create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. This project will involve four key data science techniques â€” feature engineering with text data, using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models, validating the performance of a model and minimize overfitting, and generating &amp; analyzing precision-recall curves. Part 1 of the project will involve EDAs and basic feature engineerings, training my logistic regression model. In Part 2 of the project, I will evaluate the classifiers I built in part 1, and attempt to modify my previous logistic regression model by finding better features, cleaning my data, and training my model for cross validation. I then submitted my final project to Kaggle to achieve a minimum 88% accuracy score.
